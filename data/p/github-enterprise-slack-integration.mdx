We are going to deep dive in the three ways to connect your engineering team into Slack with GitHub Enterprise and how to do it. The options are:

- Axolo, the collaborative application.
- GitHub Enterprise Server, the official integration,
- Toast, the personal notification bot,

## Axolo, the collaborative application

### What is Axolo?

In opposition to the other GitHub integrations, each pull request creates an ephemeral Slack channel. Instead of notifying a whole team, Axolo only invites reviewers and assignees and sends only the information that they need to see (comments, CI/CD, GitHub Action, deployments, checks) to process the pull request in due time.

    alt="Axolo pull request checks"
    style={{ maxWidth: "550px" }}
  />
</div>

Then, you will be able to find all of your pull requests in Axolo home in Slack.

  />
</div>

## GitHub Enterprise Server

### What is GitHub Enterprise Server

GitHub Enterprise Server is a copy of the GitHub app for Slack dedicated to Enterprise customers.

This application will post commits, pull requests, and activity on GitHub Issues to a specific channel.

### How to set up GitHub Enterprise Server?

#### Step 1

In your GitHub account, select the repository you want to follow. Then, click on **Settings** in the navigation bar.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="https://axolo.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/communication/blog/github_step1.png"
    alt="GitHub Enterprise set up step 1"
    style={{ maxWidth: "450px" }}
  />
</div>

#### Step 2

In the left navigation, click on **Webhooks**, and press the **Add webhook** button.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="https://axolo.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/communication/blog/github_step2.png"
    alt="GitHub Enterprise set up step 1"
    style={{ maxWidth: "550px" }}
  />
</div>

#### Step 3

Paste `https://hooks.slack.com/services/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` as the Payload URL. Make sure that the **Content type** is `application/json` and the **SSL verification** is enabled. You can choose a wide range of events to trigger notifications, but for now, they only support commits, issues, and pull requests. Click on the **Add webhook** button.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="https://axolo.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/communication/blog/github_step3.png"
    alt="GitHub Enterprise set up step 1"
    style={{ maxWidth: "450px" }}
  />
</div>

#### Step 4

You can filter on a specific branch, choose which channel you want to send these notifications to, and personalize the label, name, and icon of your integrations.

## Toast, the personnal notification bot

### What is ToastE?

Toast is a Slack notification bot for GitHub. It sends alerts upon new pull request reviews, comments, and issues in your direct messages. ToastE is the enterprise version of Toast.
