## Emoji reaction in \_axolo channel

Axolo now sends a notification when a pull request is created and reacts with an emoji depending on the pull request status.

Default status are:

- draft: ✏️
- wip: 🔧
- reviewable: 🙏
- mergeable: 👍
- closed: 🛑
- merged: ✅

You can activate the emoji reaction in your settings in [https://app.axolo.co/settings](https://app.axolo.co/settings).

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <img

    alt="Emoji reaction on pull request"
    style={{ width: "600px" }}
  />
</div>

## Disable the Slackbot notification when a pull request is closed

We are now able to prevent Slack from sending a notification when Axolo archives a pull request channel. To enable it, every engineer needs to sign in on Axolo with Slack.

## Better engineer search in the app

It is now easier to search through your engineers in the 'Manage team members' modal

## Axolo can delete unnecessary notifications in pull request channels

Now, we delete unnecessary notifications within pull request channels to keep your conversation clean from any external noises!
