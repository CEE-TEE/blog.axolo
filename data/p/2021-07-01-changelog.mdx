## ✨ New

- Created a page for each analytics where we can see each pull requests that were taken into account with specific data.
- Allowing some bots to send messages in pull request channels.
- Label manager is now operationnal! Define Axolo behavior upon specific GitHub labels.
- In-app setting to define how many reviewers maximum you wish to invite in PR channel when you invite an entire team.

## 🔨 Improvements

- Reminders are now computed upon inactivity of business days only.
- Added tips in the onboarding Slack message about Axolo home and the `/lgtm` command.
- Taking into account only merged PR in the PR length graph.

## 🐞 Fixes

- Bug line number in code review comment where Axolo was using the wrong line number (this line within the review instead of within the entire file)
- Fixed the invite later using engineers' timeslots for code reviews.
